# **Character Mood Classifier**
**MAIS 202 Final Project**


This project's goal is to classify the mood of manga (japanese comics) characters using deep learning methods. The final product will be a website where the user will either upload an image or draw directly on the website. The model will then make a prediction based on the user's input.
